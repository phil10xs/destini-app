## Our Goal

Here is StoryBoard Game where you choose your own adventure like Bandersnatch.
In the process, I used Dart OOP principles of Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism to build a well organised project.
Most relevant functions include the Navigation.push, routes, getters, lists and visibility widget.
Expected updates would be done on the redesign of the user experience however the functionality is go to go except in the case of extra remote database infrastructure.
